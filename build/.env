# env file
# those are defined before running webpack.
# SESSION_SECRET is used as a key for encrypting session data.
# COOKIE_SECURE should be true when this app runs on HTTPS.
#   You should not forget to turn it off when running it locally.
# CLIENT_ID, TENANT_ID, SECRET, OAUTH_SERVER_URL are given from IBM Cloud App ID.
# REDIRECT_URI must be the same URL that be set at IBM Cloud App ID as a redirect URL.
# BASE_PATH must be the base path from root where all firls are put.
#   For instance, if you run this service at http://localhost:8080, this should be '/'.
#   on the IBM Cloud Functions, this should be /app/v1/web/${NAMESPACE}/${PACKAGE}/${ACTION}/
#   here is the thing or an important workaround. the trailing slash is so important here.
#   webpack tries to concatenate the base path with this path as a string, which means
#     it did it like `BASE_PATH + base`.
#   OTOH, react tries to concatenate them with removing the last slash of BASE_PATH, which means
#     it did it like `BASE_PATH.slice(0, -1) + base`.
#   So, for webpack, the slash is so needed as well as, for the react, the base should have the first slash.
